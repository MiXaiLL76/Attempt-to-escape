# Attempt to escape

The prisoner tries to escape from the castle, which consists square rooms arranged in the form of a rectangle M Ã— N.
Between any two neighboring rooms there is a door, however some rooms are closed and the prisoner can not be got into them.
In the beginning, the prisoner is in a corner room and for rescue he needs to get into the opposite corner room. 
He does not have much time, only M + N-1, including the starting and ending room on his way, that is, with each transition to the next room, the distance to the exit from the castle should decrease.
You need to find the number of different routes leading to the rescue.
